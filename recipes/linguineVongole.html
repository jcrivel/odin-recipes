    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Linguine alle Vongole, or pasta with clams, is a simple but impressive dish that combines fresh clams and al dente pasta tossed together in a garlic white wine sauce and finished with fresh parsley.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound liguine</li>
        <li>1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>3 dozen little neck clams</li>
        <li>1 can baby clams</li>
        <li>3/4 cup dry white wine</li>
        <li>10 cloves chopped garlic</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped parsley</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>1 cup pasta water</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to boil. Note: Due to the inherent saltiness of the clams, it is recommended to use less salt than normal.</li>
        <li>Heat a large pan or pot to medium-low heat with extra virgin oil. Add the garlic and saute until the garlic turns lightly golden and the anchovies mostly dissolve. Add the hot red pepper flakes to the pan and cook for another 20-30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Add the wine and whole clams to the pan. Turn the heat to medium-high and cover. Remove clams as they open and set aside in a bowl tented with foil to keep warm.</li>
        <li>While the clams are steaming add the linguine the pot of boiling water. Cook the pasta until it is 1 minute less than al dente and make sure to reserve at least 1 cup of the pasta water before draining.</li>
        <li>After all the clams have opened (discard any that do not open after 7-8 minutes) turn the heat down to medium and add half the parsley, reserved clam juice, and 1/2 cup of pasta water.</li>
        <li>Add the pasta to the sauce along with the chopped baby clams.  Thoroughly coat the pasta with the sauce and continue to cook until al dente. Once the linguine is al dente turn off the heat and mix in the whole clams and butter.</li>
        <li>Taste test and season with salt and pepper if required. If more sauce is needed just add more of the reserved pasta water to get the perfect consistency.</li>
        <li>Serve in plates with a sprinkle of fresh parsley and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil. Enjoy!</li>
